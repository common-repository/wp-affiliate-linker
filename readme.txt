== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find view and click counts? =

Our focus is to ensure that your core affiliate link cloaking plugin remains stable and just works. Whilst other affiliate link cloaking 
plugins offer these features for free, the results are not always accurate, can bloat a WordPress installation, and some users simply 
don't need them.

Click tracking, autolinking, advanced redirects, scheduled links and geotargeting are available through individual paid-for 
<a href="https://wpaffiliatelinker.com" target="_blank">Addons for WP Affiliate Linker</a>.
